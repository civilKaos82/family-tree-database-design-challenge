# Family Tree Database Design 
 
##Learning Competencies 

##Summary 

 Family Trees can be implemented with a database!

Requirements:

1. People have a first name, middle name, birth (last) name, legal (last) name, gender, and birth date
2. Come up with a way to relate people.  You should be storing the data in a way that permits constructing a family tree, and also answering questions about a family tree, e.g., "Who is this person's parents?", "Who are Steve's paternal ancestors?", "Who are Dora's descendants?", "Who are Steve's cousins?", "Who are Lila's granddaughters?", etc.

## Objectives

### Design the schema - Optimize for Memory Requirements

Design a schema satisfying the requirements above.  What is the simplest schema design (ie takes the least amount of columns and tables) that can satisfy a family tree?  

HINT:  Use the power of inference!

Use [SQL Designer](/sql.html) to create your schema.  When you are done, save the XML of your schema and copy it into the gist. Then, take a screenshot of your final schema design, and upload it using a free image-upload service like [Min.us](http://minus.com).  Paste the URL of the screenshot into your gist (before your XML code).

### Design the schema - Optimize for Speed and Flexibility

What happens if relationships like sister, brother, step-sister, cousin are also needed?  Can your original schema display this? Can you optimize your schema so you can quickly access these relations and allow for others? (Hint: this might need more tables).

Add your new schema and screen shot to your gist.
